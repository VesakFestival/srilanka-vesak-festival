								Vesak is celebrated once a year. This year, it falls on Thursday 7th May.
                                The date of Vesak changes each year as it take places at the time of the first 
								full moon of the ancient lunar month of Vesakha, which usually falls in May or early June.
                                <br>
								<br>
								Each Buddhist culture has its own traditions for the day, but it is
								celebrated in lots of different countries, including many across Asia 
								such as: India, Thailand, and North and South Korea.
                                Many Buddhists will go to their local temple and some might even stay 
								there throughout the day and night of the full moon.
                                <br>
								<br>
								Many will do good deeds, take part in chanting and meditation, 
								reflect on Buddhist teachings, bring offerings to 
								the temple and share food with people.
                                Families may decorate their homes with lanterns, 
								take part in processions and wear special white 
								clothes to mark the occasion. Friends and family 
								may also send cards to each other.
                                A ceremony called Bathing the Buddha may also be held, 
								when water is poured over the shoulders of the Buddha 
								to remind people to clear their minds of negative thoughts like greed and hatred.

			   <h4>Birthday of the Lord Buddha</h4>
			   <p>
				Siddhartha Gautama, the Lord Buddha, 
				was born in 623 B.C. in the famous gardens of 
				Lumbini, which soon became a place of pilgrimage.
				 Among the pilgrims was the Indian emperor Ashoka, 
				 who erected one of his commemorative pillars there. 
				 The site is now being developed as a Buddhist pilgrimage 
				 centre, where the archaeological remains associated with the 
				 birth of the Lord Buddha form a central feature

			   <h4>Enlightenment of Buddha</h4>
			   <p>
				
				  Buddhism encourages its people to avoid self-indulgence but 
				  also self-denial. Buddha's most important teachings, known as The 
				  Four Noble Truths, are essential to understanding the religion.
				  Bodh Gaya contains one of the holiest of Buddhist sites: the location 
				  where, under the sacred pipal, or Bo tree, Gautama Buddha (Prince Siddhartha) 
				  attained enlightenment and became the Buddha.
			   </p>
		  </div>
		  
		  <div class="features-cal">
				<img src="image/pic-3new.png">
			   <h4>Parinirvana Of Buddha</h4>
			   <p>
				In Buddhism, parinirvana is commonly used to refer 
				to nirvana-after-death, which occurs upon the death of 
				someone who has attained nirvana during his or her lifetime.
				 It implies a release from the Saṃsāra, karma and rebirth as well
				  as the dissolution of the skandhas.
				  parinirvana of Gautama Buddha was in the region of Rampurva:
				   where the Buddha died may be ultimately 
				   found to the North of Bettiah
